Simple project of a photo gallery in Swift.
The goal of this project is to show a (for now) simple project following the Clean Code rules for swift.
In each class I will explain with clean code principles I'm using and the reasons for using them.

Currently there is an App from me on the Apple Store: Tag&find https://appsto.re/de/mZgZdb.i
And this new project is meant to be a "Lessons learned" project from my experience from Tag&find.

Simple project of a photo gallery in Swift.

Currently there is an App from me on the Apple Store: 
Tag&find https://appsto.re/de/mZgZdb.i

The goal of this project is to show a (for now) simple project following the Clean Code and Best Practices rules for swift.
In each class, I will explain the clean code principles I'm using, and the reasons for using them.

This project is meant to be a "Lessons learned" project from my experience from Tag&find.

*** UI and Unit tests coming soon ***
